# osu-reverse-mapper

This is a browser-based tool that lets you create an osu! map and matching replay by moving your cursor and clicking.

## Features

- Hitcircle mapping based on real-time cursor position and clicks
- Live visualization of hit circles as you play
- Replay generation using recorded input data
- Load your own skin and beatmap
- Edge mode to place circles offset from the cursor center
- Snapping and mod options

## How it works

It records your mouse position and key presses, then writes a valid `.osz` map file and `.osr` replay file.
